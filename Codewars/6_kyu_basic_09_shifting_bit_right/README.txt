Your task is to determine the Next Lower Power of 2 to a given
input number - or something like that...;-)

Here it's easy, you don't have to check errors or incorrect input 
values, every thing is ok without bad tricks, only int numbers as 
input and output;-)...

And please consider: You have to use bit shift operations to solve
this "problem", no multiplication, no Math.Pow() or **...

Some easy examples:

Input: 2     => Output: 1 
Input: 7     => Output: 4
Input: 0     => Output: ?
Input: -128  => Output: -256

There are some static tests at the beginning and many random tests
if you submit your solution.
